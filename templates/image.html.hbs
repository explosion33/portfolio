         I decided to write Image Converter to fill a very specific gap in my workflow.
         I often take pictures on my phone then upload them to my computer for projects.
         My phone saves photos in either HEIC or HEIF which is generally incompatible
         with windows. At this point I was fed up having to open some external website
         every time I needed a photo â€¦ So, I decided to make my own application.

          I settled on creating a desktop app with QT and C++. At this point in time
          this was my first major GUI based desktop application. However, I think the
          results turned out great.

          It was a challenge to create a responsive GUI that could still
          process images at the same time. This involved me figuring out
          how to use threads with C++, and how to manage objects and data
          across them. I also struggled to find libraries for a few of the
          formats I was trying to support. This ended up a great opportunity
          for me to research how the given image formats worked and re-create
          an encoder and decoder myself.

          In the end I ended up with a lot of knowledge on desktop GUI systems,
          C++ threading, and image formats and handling.
