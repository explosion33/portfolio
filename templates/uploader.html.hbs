        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p class="project__description">
          Uploader is a relatively simple concept, but it fills a
          very important gap in current file sharing methods. The
          objective of this project was to solve the real-world problem
          that is transferring large files between devices, with relative
          ease. Applications like Dropbox or Gmail either have significant
          client applications or significant file size limitations.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="about center">
        <p class="project__description">
          Uploader allows for an arbitrary large file to be uploaded to a
          server, which responds with a download link containing a unique
          file token. This link can then be shared through any medium and
          downloaded on the new device.

        <h3>Technology</h3>
        <p class="project__description">
          The overall stack is built around Flask (Python), using HTML, Jinja,
          and Bootstrap to achieve a scalable site that still looks good. The
          site also utilizes vanilla JavaScript along with AJAX to handle asynchronous
          file post requests, as well as the URL callback upon upload completion.
          The server runs behind an NGINX and UWSGI instance, to handle efficient
          routing with multiple requests at once.
        </p>

          Another interesting note is that this site was fully developed around CI / CD.
          The application is built into a Docker container hosted on Docker Hub. I use a
          webhook system to notify the Kubernetes cluster that runs the site, that a new
          image is ready to be downloaded.

          This was extended only to meet my personal needs on file transfers â€“ there is
          plenty of room to develop logins for retention of files by user, file inventory
          interfaces and some level of administrative oversight such as retention, use and
          access.
